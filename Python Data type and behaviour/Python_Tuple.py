#Program to get all functions of the tuple data structure

'''
    Tuple is similar to list

    immutable data structure
    duplicate values can be added
    list is mutable while tuple is immutable

tup1 = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)

tup2 = (5, 6, 7, 8, 9)

#print elements of the tuple:
print(tup1[0])
print(tup1[2])

#tuple slicing:
print(tup1[3:])
print(tup1[-4:-2])
